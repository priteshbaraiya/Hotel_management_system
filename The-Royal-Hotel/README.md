# The Royal Hotel

This project is a web application for a hotel booking system.

## Frontend

The frontend is an Angular application located in the `frontend` directory.

### UI Changes

The following changes have been made to the user interface:

- The navbar has been moved to be on top of the hero image.
- The "Top Cities" and "Main Content" sections have been removed from the home page.
- The styling has been updated to reflect these changes.

### Running the application
